# Roadmap to learn Data Science

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that includes knowledge of: 

- Programming in languages such as:
    - Python (Recommended)
    - R
    - Scala
    - Julia

- An understanding of:
    - Data Structures
    - Object Oriented Programing
    - Functional Programming
    
- Version Control
    - Git
    - Gitlab
    - Bitbucket
    
- Data Wrangling  -> Please see the [Data Analyst Roadmap](https://github.com/66daysofdata/Resources/tree/main/DataAnalyst)

- Data Visualization -> Please see the [Data Analyst Roadmap](https://github.com/66daysofdata/Resources/tree/main/DataAnalyst)

- Visual Storytelling -> Please see the [Data Analyst Roadmap](https://github.com/66daysofdata/Resources/tree/main/DataAnalyst)

- Probability and Statistics -> Please see the [Data Analyst Roadmap](https://github.com/66daysofdata/Resources/tree/main/DataAnalyst)

- Calculus
    - Including Derivatives & Integrals 
    
- Linear Algebra
    - Matrices & Eigen Values
    
- Relational Database Systems
    - MySQL
    - PostgreSQL
    
- Non-Relational Databases a.k.a NoSQL
    - MongoDB
    - Cassandra
    
- Machine Learning Algorithms -> Please see the [Machine Learning Roadmap](https://github.com/66daysofdata/Resources/tree/main/machine_learning)
    - Supervised
    - Unsupervised
    - Reinforcement
    
- Deep Learning -> Please see the [Deep Learning Roadmap](https://github.com/66daysofdata/Resources/blob/main/deep_learning/README.md)
    - Artificial Neural Networks
    - Convolutional Neural Networks
    - Recurrent Neural Networks
    - Deep Learning Platforms
        - Tensorflow
        - Pytorch
        - Keras
        - CNTK

- Big Data at Scale
    - Spark (PySpark)
    - Hadoop Ecosystem
        - Including Pig, Hive, etc ...
        
- Data Engineering -> please see the [Data Engineering roadmap](https://github.com/datastacktv/data-engineer-roadmap)

- Software Engineering Best Practices
    - Writing pythonic code
    - Testing and debugging
 
 - Python frameworks
    - Django
    - Flask
    - FastAPI
    - Streamlit (front-end)
       

As a consequence, some Data Science specializations overlap and some of their subfields can be studied separately.
Such is the case for Data Analyst, Machine Learning and Deep learning Engineer as well as Data Engineers.  One of the first step to take if you are a beginner is to follow the Data Analyst road, then proceed to Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and finally the Data Engineering roadmap.

Moreover, Here you will find some resources to learn Data Science that are not included in the other fields.
If you feel that you don't see what you are looking for please take a look at the other roadmap resources available.
