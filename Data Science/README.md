- Software Engineering Best Practices
    - Writing pythonic code by using PEP8 Standards
    - Testing and debugging
 
 - Machine Learning Deployment (Also part of DE skills and DevOps)
    - Flask
    - FastAPI
    - Streamlit
       
As a consequence, some Data Science specializations overlap and some of their subfields can be studied separately.
Such is the case for Data Analyst, Machine Learning and Deep learning Engineer as well as Data Engineers.  One of the first step to take if you are a beginner is to follow the Data Analyst road, then proceed to Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and finally the Data Engineering roadmap.

Moreover, Here you will find some resources to learn Data Science that are not included in the other fields.
If you feel that you don't see what you are looking for please take a look at the other roadmap resources available.
