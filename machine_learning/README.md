# Machine Learning Engineering Roadmap

Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.  It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

Types of machine learning include supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, reinforcement and clustering learning.

Some common algorithms are:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- SVM
- Naive Bayes
- KNN K-Means
- Random Forest
- Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms
- Gradient Boosting algorithms (GBM)
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost

For other algorithms or subdisciplines please see the Deep Learning roadmap.
