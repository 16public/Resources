# Machine Learning Engineering Roadmap

Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.  It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.  [view source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

Types of machine learning include supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, reinforcement and clustering learning.

Some common algorithms are:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Suport Vector Machines (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- KNN K-Means
- Random Forest
- Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (e.g. PCA)
- Gradient Boosting algorithms (GBM)
- [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/)

You can check out [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) for a complete guide of all the machine learning models. 

For statistics check the [data analyst section](https://github.com/66daysofdata/Resources/tree/main/DataAnalyst), for calculus and linear algebra see the [data science section](https://github.com/66daysofdata/Resources/tree/main/data_science), and for other specializations such as neural networks, natural language processing, reinforcement learning and computer vision please see the [deep learning section](https://github.com/66daysofdata/Resources/tree/main/deep_learning).

Here will focus mainly in learning machine learning techniques, including supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, feature engineering and selection, model selection and evaluation.


**Supervised vs. Unsupervised Machine Learning**
| Parameters | Supervised machine learning technique | Unsupervised machine learning technique |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------| 
|Input Data	| Algorithms are trained using labeled data.| Algorithms are used against data which is not labelled |
Computational Complexity | Supervised learning is a simpler method. |	Unsupervised learning is computationally complex |
Accuracy | Highly accurate and trustworthy method | 	Less accurate and trustworthy method |
