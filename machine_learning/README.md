# Machine Learning Engineering Roadmap

Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.  It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

    <td>https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-no-code-intro-to-the-9-most-important-machine-learning-algorithms-today/</td>
    <td>A very useful intro to 9 of the most used machine learning algorithms used. Even better, it is light on pure maths, and more heavy on the explaining concepts side ... and using normal and plain english to boot! IMPORTANT! -> Be sure to check the rest of the site as you'll probably find a ton of other useful stuff there!</td>
